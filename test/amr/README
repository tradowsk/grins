Currently, there are a couple of assumptions about the file naming.

1. The "gold data" should have <prefix>.<int>.xdr naming scheme while
   the "gold mesh" files should have <prefix>_mesh.<int>.exo naming scheme.

2. The "test data" (rewritten out during the GRINS run) should have <prefix>.<int>.xdr
   naming scheme while the mesh files should be <prefix>.<int>_mesh.xda. These currently
   correspond to the default outputs from output_formats = 'xdr mesh_only' in the input file.
